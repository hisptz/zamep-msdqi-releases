## Custom forms configurations

Custom configuration has been down with concept of tables and division of checklist into combination of checklist's section and sub sections. In which section or subsection can have tables's rows as row of inputs fields or labels as per checklist paper based design.

The two major overall design based on JSON format and pattern for checklist's custom desing, one for **QIP** which is a bit trick as it has some custom logics and custom input fields and other which is common for rest of checklist (**\*ANC, IPD, OPD, Logistics, Microscopy, mRDT and SME**).

The design can editied with any JSON editor or using [Online JSON Editor](https://jsoneditoronline.org/) for easy editing these custom designs.
